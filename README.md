# Dependencies

The widget depends on `anywidget` and `traitlets`.

# Development

To install the widget for development/editing you can run simply run
```bash
pip install -e .
```
which will also run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build` to build the
frontend code.


Then when you modify the frontend widget code, recompile it
by running:
```bash
pnpm run build
```

# Building

The widget frontend code is built when running the python build 
command via hatchling which will also install pnpm dependencies
and build the frontend code. Build via
```bash
python -m build
```

Build artifacts are placed in `dist/`
